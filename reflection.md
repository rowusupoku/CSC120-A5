- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affectes your programming?
    Association allows you to organize your code and much more readable. It also makes the code run faster. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    I attempted to make a stylized banner but I had trouble making it work so that the words fit and decided to stick with something closer to Jordan's given banner. I would suggest for someone who takes this course in the future to always attend TA hours at least once a week.
